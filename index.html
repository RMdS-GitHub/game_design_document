                <!--Concept statement.-->
                <h4 class="sub-header">Concept statement</h4>
                <p>The game in a tweet: one or two sentences at most that say 
                    what the game is and why it’s fun.</p>
                <p>A game concept statement or premise is a brief, direct 
                    description of the situation of a game. It describes the 
                    goal of the player, the resistance to this goal and the 
                    means by which this goal is achieved. If it's all about the 
                    narrative part of the script, the game concept reads like a 
                    script. Realistically, the gameplay is described as it 
                    influences some elements of storytelling. 
                    A short example could be as follows:</p>

                <p>"In Trick or Treat, players are trapped in the labyrinth of 
                    an old haunted house, escaping by destroying enemy monsters, 
                    dodging traps, and solving the maze." Trick or Treat is a 
                    third-person action-spying game. "</p>

                <p>The purpose of this letter is to give the reader a sense of 
                    the game. It should answer these basic questions:</p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>What is the goal of the game?</li>
                        <li>How is the goal of the game achieved?</li>
                        <li>What are the challenges to the game?</li>
                        <li>Where does the game take place?</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Most people want to add marketing jargon and implementation 
                    specifications. That's just a mistake. Reporting that it's 
                    the best game ever, or that it will be available for the 
                    PS10 in 2020, simply does not strengthen a concept. 
                    To put it bluntly: This statement is about the concept. 
                    Concepts are general terms at a high level. 
                    For example, the concept of a car on the Indianapolis 500 
                    did not begin with the use of carbon fiber.</p>

                <p>Do not include the following elements in your letter:</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Gaming platform (eg for the NES, because I'm retro-chic)</li>
                    <li>Game rating (eg "M" for adults)</li>
                    <li>Special features of the game (eg controls)</li>
                    <li>Game programming details (using, for example, recursive algorithms for speed)</li>
                    <li>Marketing (eg "more exciting than a rollercoaster ride")</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are exceptions to every rule. Sometimes it is important 
                    to add implementation details. These are exceptionally rare 
                    situations, eg. For example, a game designed solely for use 
                    with a new controller type or for use on a non-standard 
                    gaming platform. In these cases, it makes sense to touch the 
                    distinctive detail.</p>

                <h4 class="sub-header">Target audience</h4>
                <p>Motivations and relevant interests; potentially age, gender, etc.; 
                    and the desired ESRB rating for the game.</p>
                <p>Your game’s target audience is the demographics and interests 
                of the majority of it’s players. For example if you’re launching 
                a match-3 puzzle game, your target audience is likely female, 35 
                years of age, and cares mostly about achievement over all other 
                aspects of the game.</p>
                <p>But before you’ve launched your game, before you’ve gathered 
                any real player data, you’ll need to make an educated guess about 
                who your players might be, so that you can make and market your 
                game to attract them. Contrary to popular belief, not all games 
                benefit from the same marketing channels, tactics and strategies.</p>
                <p>And investing what little time and money you have on marketing 
                the wrong way can lead to devastating losses, if not failure.
                In fact, it’s such an important part of launching games that AAA 
                publishers spend exorbitant amounts of money building in-house 
                teams whose sole responsibility is to gather this research and 
                use it to decide whether or not they should move forward with 
                even making games that are in the conceptual phases of development.
                However if you’re a bootstrapping indie game developer, you probably 
                don’t have access to those teams or their tools. But you still 
                need some idea of who your target audience is.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest mistakes that indie game developers make is 
                believing that their target audience is made up of people who are 
                just like them. After all, they typically make the games they want 
                to play. And that’s ok, a lot of great games are made that way, 
                but it doesn’t necessarily mean your target audience is anything 
                like you.You and your games are far better served with the more 
                data-driven approach of measuring the audiences of games that 
                are similar to yours. 
                It’s called a lookalike audience, as in your-audience-probably-
                looks-like-their-audience.
                    
                <p>Here’s the gist of what you’ll be doing:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The first thing you’ll do is make a list of your game’s 3 biggest competitors.</li>
                    <li>Then you mine their audiences for demographics and interests, documenting the results along the way.</li>
                    <li>And finally you’ll note the overlap to find your game’s tentative target audience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I call this the Lookalike Target Audience Research Method. Obviously, 
                    it’s not rocket science. It’s just common sense, and you’ve 
                    probably already been thinking this way. Unfortunately, there’s 
                    no empirical way to prove your game’s target audience before 
                    you launch. All assumptions, by you or big AAA publishers, 
                    are still assumptions. Building a target audience profile 
                    from competitor data is the best way to make a best guess 
                    about who your game’s target audience might be.
                    And that’s really all you need to move forward with.</p>
                    
                <p>You don’t really need teams of people, data warehouse 
                    subscriptions, and keynote presentation decks being pitched 
                    to people in suits. Sure, those help. But they’re nice-to-haves, 
                    and not really need-to-haves for where you’re at.</p>

                <h4 class="sub-header">Unique Selling Points</h4>
                <p>Critically important. What makes your game stand out? How is 
                    it different from all other games?</p>
                <p>With this in mind, you can start to build your USP (Unique Selling Points).
                    There is not an unique definition for it, the best statements
                    that I found for the video game industry are these.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Each advertisement must make a proposition to the 
                              consumer—not just words, product puffery, or show-window 
                              advertising. 
                              Each advertisement must say to each reader: "Buy this 
                              product, for this specific benefit."</li>
                    <li>The proposition must be one the competition cannot or 
                              does not offer. It must be unique—either in the brand 
                              or in a claim the rest of that particular advertising 
                              area does not make.</li>
                    <li>The proposition must be strong enough to move the masses, 
                              i.e., attract new customers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can now move on to the positioning part.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>For (target customer) who (statement of the need or

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This could be translated into “For (young, jaded hipster who 
                        grew up liking games) who (now feels that games have strayed 
                        too far into the mainstream), (Unbearable Sounds and 
                        Glitchy Graphics) is a (shit game) that (no one else have

                        this game (will make you feel unique).”</p> 
                <p>Remove the snarkiness and you can easily see how this 
                        complements/works in mysterious ways with the USP definition. 
                </p>
                <p>To define your USP these are the things you need to think about.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Who are you as a studio?:<br><p id="list-p">Start by creating an overview

                        stand for, your strengths and weaknesses. Assess your development 
                        team to see what extra skills and technologies you need to 
                        invest in to ensure you can meet the development needs 
                        of modern games.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>What does your game do to fill a role in the gaming industry?<br>
                        <p id="list-p">You don’t necessarily have to be a pioneer in the industry 
                        for your game to be successful. There are a lot of games 
                        that are built on the success of other titles and the secret 
                        has been to find a role in a specific niche and play it well. 
                        Work with your development team to find the issues your 
                        target audience needs to be addressed and craft a USP 
                        that signifies your promise to address those issues.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>What part of your game addresses that niche?<br><p id="list-p">Make it 
                        clear what part of your game addresses the pain points 
                        gamers experience when playing titles in your niche. 
                        This will make your game relatable and entice more players

                        USP should highlight what makes your game different from 
                        the competition. Gamers value authenticity and your USP 
                        should clearly point out the factors that make your game 
                        unique. The main role of your USP is to give reasons why 
                        prospects should download your game, and stating the 
                        unique issues that make it different from the competition 
                        will help generate more interest.</p>

                        specific needs of gamers in your niche, the value your 
                        game brings to the prospects becomes evident, and this

                        your audience. Understanding the goals and desires of 
                        your target users will make it easy to come up with a USP 
                        that will immediately capture their attention. If you 
                        don’t have a clear description of your target users, 
                        check out your competitors to see what kind of people 
                        they are targeting with their marketing messages.</p>
                    </li>

                        highly saturated and for gamers to even glance your way, 
                        your game needs to satisfy the above criteria. 
                        Game marketing experts advise that developers sit down 
                        with everyone involved with the game and list all the 
                        issues that may influence gamers to choose their title

                <p>Who is the player? What is the setting? What is the fantasy 
                    the game grants the player? What emotions do
                    you want the player to feel? What keeps the player engaged 
                    for the duration of their play?</p>
                <p>To describe the player experience I found an article from an
                    UX designer that create a model specific for gaming.
                    In his model there are 5 planes, motivation,meaningful choices,
                    balance, usability, aesthetics.
                <p>The model also serves as a process map. The planes are arranged 
                    in the sequence in which they would ideally be tackled, 
                    starting from the reasons for playing, progressing through 
                    the core mechanics of the game, and finishing with the surface 
                    level experience. There's little point in designing for the 
                    next plane until the prior one has at least been adequately 
                    thought through (although work on the later planes will almost 
                    always lead to iterations on the earlier ones). Designers can 
                    run into trouble if they skip over planes or start 
                    from the wrong end.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Motivation:<br><p id="list-p">The first thing to think about is who 
                        the players are and why they would want to play the game. 
                        This plane comprises two main elements. In the short term, 
                        there's the up-front “interestingness” of the experience—the 
                        basic spark that grabs people and creates joy in the interaction. 
                        In Pac-Man, this is the race to clear the board while being 
                        pursued by enemies. In CityVille, it's the combination of 
                        creative control over the city and the challenge of managing 
                        its growth. In checkers and chess, it's the puzzle of 
                        figuring out how to attack your opponent while defending 
                        your own positions. These are all tied to basic human 
                        drives to complete a job, to create, and to feel competent, 
                        which are just a handful of the many motivations that 
                        make play a fundamental function of living.</p>

                        <p id="list-p">The second element of motivation is the system of rewards 
                        that sustains interest in the experience over time. 
                        Pac-Man has points and leaderboards. CityVille offers 
                        access to an expanding set of game items, coupled with a 
                        social experience shared among a growing circle of friends. 
                        In checkers and chess, it's the satisfaction of proving 
                        that you're cleverer than your opponent. Rewards become 
                        increasingly important the longer a game runs, but they 
                        can also grow stale as the player gets used to receiving 
                        them. For very long engagements, diversifying and layering 
                        rewards can persuade players to stay involved.</p>

                        The next plane defines how the game's 
                        structure and rules allow players to exercise choices 
                        that influence the outcomes of events. Such meaningful 
                        choices are present in all good games, though they can 
                        take quite different forms. Chess relies heavily on 
                        long-term strategy—the anticipation of what will happen 
                        far downstream when you take a move now. Twitchy action games 
                        typically involve more short-range tactical decisions, 
                        which are completed rapidly and in high volumes at the 
                        fine-motor level.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">
                        The challenge of consistently making better moves is the 
                        fundamental conflict that makes play engaging. Games work 
                        best when there's a partial ambiguity between which actions 
                        will result in better or worse outcomes. They can easily 
                        lose their appeal when players either have no basis for 
                        distinguishing between choices (too much ambiguity), or 
                        when there's clearly only one choice that has any real 
                        merit (no ambiguity at all).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Balance:<br>
                        <p id="list-p">This is the extent to which the game's elements 
                            work in combination to create a system that's 
                            appropriately challenging, but which players still 
                            perceive as fair and equitable. In an unbalanced role 
                            playing game, for example, players might earn gold so 
                            easily from battles that they can purchase the most 
                            advanced weapons and armor right away for use against 
                            the weakest enemies. On the other hand, if they earned 
                            too little gold then the game would demand too much work 
                            of them and become frustrating.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">Video games contain multiple variables for 
                            which there is some range of values that need to be 
                            set so they're not too high or too low, but just right. 
                            But games are dynamic systems, and the interplay of 
                            these variables can be very complex and hard to 
                            completely anticipate. Even if a game works really 
                            well in a few scenarios, there may be lots of edge 
                            cases where it goes completely haywire and the 
                            experience becomes unsatisfying. The best way to 
                            ensure a balanced game is through iterative prototyping 
                            and testing, allowing the problems to emerge from actual 
                            play.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Usability:<br>
                        <p id="list-p">While this plane certainly includes all 
                            of the interface concerns that we know so well in 
                            the UX world, there are also usability considerations 
                            that are specific to game experiences. Importantly, 
                            the design needs to support a sensible experience, 
                            where players understand the things that happen in 
                            the game and how their actions affect them.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">This means that when players lose they 
                            should understand why they lost, and when they win 
                            they should understand why they won. When something 
                            happens in the game, players should be able to 
                            attribute it to a cause that they can perceive and 
                            understand. Players should also always be able to 
                            understand the actions that are available to them, 
                            as well as the objectives they should be working 
                            toward (or they should at least have a reasonable 
                            opportunity to figure them out). These are the 
                            qualities that enable a feeling of control over the 
                            experience in the short term, and that allow players 
                            to develop mastery of the game over time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Aesthetics:<br>
                        <p id="list-p">The last plane encompasses the many 
                            aspects of the game's aesthetic design. In the short 
                            term there's the direct sensory experience, which 
                            includes images sound as well as the haptics of force 
                            feedback and vibrating game controllers. Stylistic 
                            choices in writing and art set the game's tone—whether 
                            funny, serious, foreboding, or silly. Many games also 
                            contain more contemplative elements that unfold over 
                            the long term, such as narratives with evolving story 
                            arcs.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">A game's aesthetics can be readily changed 
                            without affecting the underlying mechanics governing 
                            play. You can swap standard black and white chess pieces 
                            out with civil war, ancient Chinese, or Star Trek figures, 
                            but you're still playing chess. So it's important that the 
                            underlying planes of the experience are sound, no matter 
                            how glossy the surface is.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">Nonetheless, the aesthetic has a profound 
                            impact on the player's experience of the game. 
                            You can't peel the artful qualities of Red Dead 
                            Redemption or Plants vs. Zombies away from their game 
                            mechanics without completely changing each one's effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>What about fun?
                        <p id="list-p">You might be wondering how enjoyment and 
                            fun factor into this model. Those qualities can't be 
                            designed directly, but rather emerge from the experience 
                            when all of the elements work together well. 
                            Conversely, fun dies when any of the planes haven't 
                            been adequately addressed.</p>

                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Point of View in Video Games is a complicated subject.
                The camera in video games is generally either first-person or third-person.</p>
                
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Camera Views<p id="list-p">A first-person view means the camera is, essentially, 
                    glued to the main character’s forehead looking forward. The player 
                    sees what the character sees. This can lead to a greater sense of 
                    connection with the main character, because the player is inside 
                    the character’s head, so to speak. The disadvantage is that this 
                    is not truly a first-person view, because a typical human’s 
                    peripheral vision is wider than the screen (and a typical human 
                    can turn their head faster than a typical first-person video game camera), 
                    which can break immersion at times for players who are not used to the 
                    limitations.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">In a third-person camera view, the player is instead looking 
                    at the main character, usually from a behind-the-shoulder there 
                    perspective so that you usually see the character’s backside. 
                    This gives a wider view of the area and is more realistic in 
                    terms of giving the player the visual information that the 
                    character would have. Of course, by looking at the main character 
                    all the time, it brings a sense of otherness – you can’t look 
                    at your own backside without the aid of mirrors, so this camera 
                    view is a reminder that the main character is not you.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">Combining this with McCloud’s point on icons versus realism 
                    (from last time), we might guess that a first-person character 
                    is closer to an icon and tends to do better as a “blank slate” 
                    character that the player can project their own personality onto, 
                    while a third-person character that is drawn realistically 
                    should have strong characterization.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">A second-person camera view, if it existed, would involve 
                    the camera that spends the entire time looking at the main 
                    character from the front. Needless to say, this would be 
                    confusing in the vast majority of games. The closest I’ve seen 
                    is an obscure console title, Robot Alchemic Drive, where you control 
                    a human character (in third person) that is in turn controlling a 
                    giant robot by remote control (in second person). To the extent 
                    that the robot is the main character, this game uses a second-person 
                    camera for control.</p></li>
                    
                    
                    <li>Story Views
                    <p id="list-p">We also use the words “first person” and “third person” when 
                    discussing literature. There, it works a bit differently.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">A first-person story is when the story is told from the narrator’s 
                    own point of view. The main character is addressing the reader 
                    directly, telling you a story of what happened to them.</p> 
                    <p id="list-p">A third-person story, which is more common, is when the story 
                    is told from an outside perspective (much like a typical movie 
                    camera, where the view just represents a “fly on the wall” 
                    and not an actual character’s viewpoint). This may be “third-person 
                    omniscient” where the reader can see things that happen and even 
                    hear several characters’ thoughts, or “third-person limited” where 
                    some information (such as character thoughts) is concealed from the reader.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">A rare kind of story in literature is that of second-person, 
                    where the story is told from the reader’s point of view. 
                    This kind of story is rare because it is very hard to write 
                    in a way that is believable.You might be realizing about this 
                    time that almost every game narrative is told in second person. 
                    This is the case whenever the player is controlling the main 
                    character, which is most of the time. And this is another reason 
                    why storytelling in games is so hard.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p>Be aware that in gaming there is also the question of perspective.
                In the end of this document I left some links about the subject.

                <h4 class="sub-header">Visual and Audio Style</h4>
                <p>Video game music is the soundtrack that accompanies video games. 
                    Early video game music was once limited to simple melodies of 
                    early sound synthesizer technology. These limitations inspired 
                    the style of music known as chiptunes, which combines simple melodic 
                    styles with more complex patterns or traditional music styles, 
                    and became the most popular sound of the first video games.</p>
                <p>With advances in technology, video game music has grown to include 
                    the same breadth and complexity associated with television and 
                    film scores, allowing for much more creative freedom. 
                    While simple synthesizer pieces are still common, game music 
                    now includes full orchestral pieces and popular music. 
                    Music in video games can be heard over a game's title screen, 
                    menus, as well as during gameplay. Game soundtracks can also 
                    change depending on a player's actions or situation, such as 
                    indicating missed actions in rhythm games, informing the player 
                    they are in a dangerous situation or rewarding them for certain achievements.</p>
                <p>Video game music can be one of two options: original or licensed. 
                    In order to create or collect this music, teams of composers, 
                    music directors, and music supervisors must work with the game 
                    developers and game publishers. 
                    The popularity of video game music has expanded education and 
                    job opportunities, generated awards, and allowed video game soundtracks 
                    to be commercially sold and performed in concerts.</p>
