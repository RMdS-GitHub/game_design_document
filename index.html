                <!--Concept statement.-->
                <h4 class="sub-header">Concept statement</h4>
                <p class="ex">The game in a tweet: one or two sentences at most that say 
                    what the game is and why it’s fun.</p>
                <p>A game concept statement or premise is a brief, direct 
                    description of the situation of a game. It describes the 
                    goal of the player, the resistance to this goal and the 
                    means by which this goal is achieved. If it's all about the 
                    narrative part of the script, the game concept reads like a 
                    script. Realistically, the gameplay is described as it 
                    influences some elements of storytelling. 
                    A short example could be as follows:</p>

                <p>"In Trick or Treat, players are trapped in the labyrinth of 
                    an old haunted house, escaping by destroying enemy monsters, 
                    dodging traps, and solving the maze." Trick or Treat is a 
                    third-person action-spying game. "</p>

                <p>The purpose of this letter is to give the reader a sense of 
                    the game. It should answer these basic questions:</p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>What is the goal of the game?</li>
                        <li>How is the goal of the game achieved?</li>
                        <li>What are the challenges to the game?</li>
                        <li>Where does the game take place?</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Most people want to add marketing jargon and implementation 
                    specifications. That's just a mistake. Reporting that it's 
                    the best game ever, or that it will be available for the 
                    PS10 in 2020, simply does not strengthen a concept. 
                    To put it bluntly: This statement is about the concept. 
                    Concepts are general terms at a high level. 
                    For example, the concept of a car on the Indianapolis 500 
                    did not begin with the use of carbon fiber.</p>

                <p>Do not include the following elements in your letter:</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Gaming platform (eg for the NES, because I'm retro-chic)</li>
                    <li>Game rating (eg "M" for adults)</li>
                    <li>Special features of the game (eg controls)</li>
                    <li>Game programming details (using, for example, recursive algorithms for speed)</li>
                    <li>Marketing (eg "more exciting than a rollercoaster ride")</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are exceptions to every rule. Sometimes it is important 
                    to add implementation details. These are exceptionally rare 
                    situations, eg. For example, a game designed solely for use 
                    with a new controller type or for use on a non-standard 
                    gaming platform. In these cases, it makes sense to touch the 
                    distinctive detail.</p>

                <p>Your game’s target audience is the demographics and interests 
                of the majority of it’s players. For example if you’re launching 
                a match-3 puzzle game, your target audience is likely female, 35 
                years of age, and cares mostly about achievement over all other

                <p>But before you’ve launched your game, before you’ve gathered

                who your players might be, so that you can make and market your 
                game to attract them. Contrary to popular belief, not all games 
                benefit from the same marketing channels, tactics and strategies.</p>
                <p>And investing what little time and money you have on marketing 
                the wrong way can lead to devastating losses, if not failure.
                In fact, it’s such an important part of launching games that AAA 
                publishers spend exorbitant amounts of money building in-house 
                teams whose sole responsibility is to gather this research and 
                use it to decide whether or not they should move forward with 
                even making games that are in the conceptual phases of development.
                However if you’re a bootstrapping indie game developer, you probably 
                don’t have access to those teams or their tools. But you still 
                need some idea of who your target audience is.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest mistakes that indie game developers make is 
                believing that their target audience is made up of people who are 
                just like them. After all, they typically make the games they want 
                to play. And that’s ok, a lot of great games are made that way, 
                but it doesn’t necessarily mean your target audience is anything 
                like you.You and your games are far better served with the more 
                data-driven approach of measuring the audiences of games that 
                are similar to yours. 
                It’s called a lookalike audience, as in your-audience-probably-
                looks-like-their-audience.
                    
                <p>Here’s the gist of what you’ll be doing:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The first thing you’ll do is make a list of your game’s 3 biggest competitors.</li>
                    <li>Then you mine their audiences for demographics and interests, documenting the results along the way.</li>
                    <li>And finally you’ll note the overlap to find your game’s tentative target audience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I call this the Lookalike Target Audience Research Method. Obviously, 
                    it’s not rocket science. It’s just common sense, and you’ve 
                    probably already been thinking this way. Unfortunately, there’s 
                    no empirical way to prove your game’s target audience before 
                    you launch. All assumptions, by you or big AAA publishers, 
                    are still assumptions. Building a target audience profile 
                    from competitor data is the best way to make a best guess 
                    about who your game’s target audience might be.
                    And that’s really all you need to move forward with.</p>
                    
                <p>You don’t really need teams of people, data warehouse 
                    subscriptions, and keynote presentation decks being pitched 
                    to people in suits. Sure, those help. But they’re nice-to-haves, 
                    and not really need-to-haves for where you’re at.</p>

                <p class="ex">Critically important. What makes your game stand out? How is

                <p>With this in mind, you can start to build your USP (Unique Selling Points).
                    There is not an unique definition for it, the best statements
                    that I found for the video game industry are these.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Each advertisement must make a proposition to the 
                              consumer—not just words, product puffery, or show-window 
                              advertising. 
                              Each advertisement must say to each reader: "Buy this 
                              product, for this specific benefit."</li>
                    <li>The proposition must be one the competition cannot or 
                              does not offer. It must be unique—either in the brand 
                              or in a claim the rest of that particular advertising 
                              area does not make.</li>
                    <li>The proposition must be strong enough to move the masses, 
                              i.e., attract new customers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can now move on to the positioning part.</p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This could be translated into “For (young, jaded hipster who 
                        grew up liking games) who (now feels that games have strayed 
                        too far into the mainstream), (Unbearable Sounds and

                <p>Remove the snarkiness and you can easily see how this 
                        complements/works in mysterious ways with the USP definition.

                        for your game to be successful. There are a lot of games

                        has been to find a role in a specific niche and play it well. 
                        Work with your development team to find the issues your 
                        target audience needs to be addressed and craft a USP 
                        that signifies your promise to address those issues.</p>

                        should clearly point out the factors that make your game 
                        unique. The main role of your USP is to give reasons why 
                        prospects should download your game, and stating the 
                        unique issues that make it different from the competition

                        Game marketing experts advise that developers sit down 
                        with everyone involved with the game and list all the 
                        issues that may influence gamers to choose their title

                <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Player Experience</h5>
                <p>To describe the player experience I found an article from an
                    UX designer that create a model specific for gaming.
                    In his model there are 5 planes, motivation,meaningful choices,
                    balance, usability, aesthetics.
                <p>The model also serves as a process map. The planes are arranged 
                    in the sequence in which they would ideally be tackled, 
                    starting from the reasons for playing, progressing through 
                    the core mechanics of the game, and finishing with the surface 
                    level experience. There's little point in designing for the 
                    next plane until the prior one has at least been adequately 
                    thought through (although work on the later planes will almost 
                    always lead to iterations on the earlier ones). Designers can 
                    run into trouble if they skip over planes or start 
                    from the wrong end.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Motivation:<br><p id="list-p">The first thing to think about is who 
                        the players are and why they would want to play the game. 
                        This plane comprises two main elements. In the short term, 
                        there's the up-front “interestingness” of the experience—the 
                        basic spark that grabs people and creates joy in the interaction. 
                        In Pac-Man, this is the race to clear the board while being 
                        pursued by enemies. In CityVille, it's the combination of 
                        creative control over the city and the challenge of managing 
                        its growth. In checkers and chess, it's the puzzle of 
                        figuring out how to attack your opponent while defending 
                        your own positions. These are all tied to basic human 
                        drives to complete a job, to create, and to feel competent, 
                        which are just a handful of the many motivations that 
                        make play a fundamental function of living.</p>

                        <p id="list-p">The second element of motivation is the system of rewards 
                        that sustains interest in the experience over time. 
                        Pac-Man has points and leaderboards. CityVille offers 
                        access to an expanding set of game items, coupled with a 
                        social experience shared among a growing circle of friends. 
                        In checkers and chess, it's the satisfaction of proving 
                        that you're cleverer than your opponent. Rewards become 
                        increasingly important the longer a game runs, but they 
                        can also grow stale as the player gets used to receiving 
                        them. For very long engagements, diversifying and layering 
                        rewards can persuade players to stay involved.</p>

                        The next plane defines how the game's 
                        structure and rules allow players to exercise choices 
                        that influence the outcomes of events. Such meaningful 
                        choices are present in all good games, though they can 
                        take quite different forms. Chess relies heavily on 
                        long-term strategy—the anticipation of what will happen 
                        far downstream when you take a move now. Twitchy action games 
                        typically involve more short-range tactical decisions, 
                        which are completed rapidly and in high volumes at the 
                        fine-motor level.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">
                        The challenge of consistently making better moves is the 
                        fundamental conflict that makes play engaging. Games work 
                        best when there's a partial ambiguity between which actions 
                        will result in better or worse outcomes. They can easily 
                        lose their appeal when players either have no basis for 
                        distinguishing between choices (too much ambiguity), or 
                        when there's clearly only one choice that has any real 
                        merit (no ambiguity at all).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Balance:<br>
                        <p id="list-p">This is the extent to which the game's elements 
                            work in combination to create a system that's 
                            appropriately challenging, but which players still 
                            perceive as fair and equitable. In an unbalanced role 
                            playing game, for example, players might earn gold so 
                            easily from battles that they can purchase the most 
                            advanced weapons and armor right away for use against 
                            the weakest enemies. On the other hand, if they earned 
                            too little gold then the game would demand too much work 
                            of them and become frustrating.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">Video games contain multiple variables for 
                            which there is some range of values that need to be 
                            set so they're not too high or too low, but just right. 
                            But games are dynamic systems, and the interplay of 
                            these variables can be very complex and hard to 
                            completely anticipate. Even if a game works really 
                            well in a few scenarios, there may be lots of edge 
                            cases where it goes completely haywire and the 
                            experience becomes unsatisfying. The best way to 
                            ensure a balanced game is through iterative prototyping 
                            and testing, allowing the problems to emerge from actual 
                            play.</p>

                    <li>Usability:<br>
                        <p id="list-p">While this plane certainly includes all 
                            of the interface concerns that we know so well in 
                            the UX world, there are also usability considerations 
                            that are specific to game experiences. Importantly, 
                            the design needs to support a sensible experience, 
                            where players understand the things that happen in 
                            the game and how their actions affect them.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">This means that when players lose they 
                            should understand why they lost, and when they win 
                            they should understand why they won. When something 
                            happens in the game, players should be able to 
                            attribute it to a cause that they can perceive and 
                            understand. Players should also always be able to 
                            understand the actions that are available to them, 
                            as well as the objectives they should be working 
                            toward (or they should at least have a reasonable 
                            opportunity to figure them out). These are the 
                            qualities that enable a feeling of control over the 
                            experience in the short term, and that allow players 
                            to develop mastery of the game over time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Aesthetics:<br>
                        <p id="list-p">The last plane encompasses the many 
                            aspects of the game's aesthetic design. In the short 
                            term there's the direct sensory experience, which 
                            includes images sound as well as the haptics of force 
                            feedback and vibrating game controllers. Stylistic 
                            choices in writing and art set the game's tone—whether 
                            funny, serious, foreboding, or silly. Many games also 
                            contain more contemplative elements that unfold over 
                            the long term, such as narratives with evolving story 
                            arcs.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">A game's aesthetics can be readily changed 
                            without affecting the underlying mechanics governing 
                            play. You can swap standard black and white chess pieces 
                            out with civil war, ancient Chinese, or Star Trek figures, 
                            but you're still playing chess. So it's important that the 
                            underlying planes of the experience are sound, no matter 
                            how glossy the surface is.</p>
                        <p id="list-p">Nonetheless, the aesthetic has a profound 
                            impact on the player's experience of the game. 
                            You can't peel the artful qualities of Red Dead 
                            Redemption or Plants vs. Zombies away from their game 
                            mechanics without completely changing each one's effect.

                    <li>What about fun?
                        <p id="list-p">You might be wondering how enjoyment and 
                            fun factor into this model. Those qualities can't be 
                            designed directly, but rather emerge from the experience 
                            when all of the elements work together well. 
                            Conversely, fun dies when any of the planes haven't

                <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Game POV</h5>
                <p>Point of View in Video Games is a complicated subject.
                The camera in video games is generally either first-person or third-person.</p>
                
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Camera Views<p id="list-p">A first-person view means the camera is, essentially, 
                    glued to the main character’s forehead looking forward. The player 
                    sees what the character sees. This can lead to a greater sense of 
                    connection with the main character, because the player is inside 
                    the character’s head, so to speak. The disadvantage is that this 
                    is not truly a first-person view, because a typical human’s 
                    peripheral vision is wider than the screen (and a typical human 
                    can turn their head faster than a typical first-person video game camera), 
                    which can break immersion at times for players who are not used to the 
                    limitations.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">In a third-person camera view, the player is instead looking 
                    at the main character, usually from a behind-the-shoulder there 
                    perspective so that you usually see the character’s backside. 
                    This gives a wider view of the area and is more realistic in 
                    terms of giving the player the visual information that the 
                    character would have. Of course, by looking at the main character 
                    all the time, it brings a sense of otherness – you can’t look 
                    at your own backside without the aid of mirrors, so this camera 
                    view is a reminder that the main character is not you.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">Combining this with McCloud’s point on icons versus realism 
                    (from last time), we might guess that a first-person character 
                    is closer to an icon and tends to do better as a “blank slate” 
                    character that the player can project their own personality onto, 
                    while a third-person character that is drawn realistically 
                    should have strong characterization.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">A second-person camera view, if it existed, would involve 
                    the camera that spends the entire time looking at the main 
                    character from the front. Needless to say, this would be 
                    confusing in the vast majority of games. The closest I’ve seen 
                    is an obscure console title, Robot Alchemic Drive, where you control 
                    a human character (in third person) that is in turn controlling a 
                    giant robot by remote control (in second person). To the extent 
                    that the robot is the main character, this game uses a second-person 
                    camera for control.</p></li>
                    
                    
                    <li>Story Views
                    <p id="list-p">We also use the words “first person” and “third person” when 
                    discussing literature. There, it works a bit differently.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">A first-person story is when the story is told from the narrator’s 
                    own point of view. The main character is addressing the reader 
                    directly, telling you a story of what happened to them.</p> 
                    <p id="list-p">A third-person story, which is more common, is when the story 
                    is told from an outside perspective (much like a typical movie 
                    camera, where the view just represents a “fly on the wall” 
                    and not an actual character’s viewpoint). This may be “third-person 
                    omniscient” where the reader can see things that happen and even 
                    hear several characters’ thoughts, or “third-person limited” where 
                    some information (such as character thoughts) is concealed from the reader.</p>
                    <p id="list-p">A rare kind of story in literature is that of second-person, 
                    where the story is told from the reader’s point of view. 
                    This kind of story is rare because it is very hard to write 
                    in a way that is believable.You might be realizing about this 
                    time that almost every game narrative is told in second person. 
                    This is the case whenever the player is controlling the main 
                    character, which is most of the time. And this is another reason 
                    why storytelling in games is so hard.</p></li>

                    the desired player’s experience? What
                    concept art or reference art can you show to give the feel 
                    of the game?
                </p>
                <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Visual Style</h5>
                <p>A variety of computer graphic techniques have been used to 
                    display video game content throughout the history of video games. 
                    The predominance of individual techniques have evolved over time, 
                    primarily due to hardware advances and restrictions such as 
                    the processing power of central or graphics processing units. 
                </p>
                <p>Some of the earliest video games were text games or text-based 
                    games that used text characters instead of bitmapped or vector 
                    graphics.
                </p>
                <p>Vector graphics refers to the use of geometrical primitives such 
                    as points, lines, and curves (i.e. shapes based on mathematical 
                    equations) instead of resolution-dependent bitmap graphics to 
                    represent images in computer graphics. 
                </p>
                <p>Vector game can also refer to a video game that uses a vector 
                    graphics display capable of projecting images using an electron 
                    beam to draw images instead of with pixels, much like a laser show. 
                    Many early arcade games used such displays, as they were capable 
                    of displaying more detailed images than raster displays on the 
                    hardware available at that time.</p>
                <p>Full motion video (FMV) games are video games that rely upon 
                    pre-recorded television- or movie-quality recordings and 
                    animations rather than sprites, vectors or 3D models to 
                    display action in the game. FMV-based games were popular 
                    during the early 1990s as CD-ROMs and Laserdiscs made their way 
                    into the living rooms, providing an alternative to the low-capacity 
                    ROM cartridges of most consoles at the time.</p>
                <p>2D games</p>
                <p>Games utilizing parallel projection typically make use of 
                    two-dimensional bitmap graphics as opposed to 3D-rendered 
                    triangle-based geometry, allowing developers to create large, 
                    complex gameworlds efficiently and with relatively few art 
                    assets by dividing the art into sprites or tiles and reusing 
                    them repeatedly (though some games use a mix of different 
                    techniques). 
                </p>
                <p>Top-down perspective, also sometimes referred to in a while as 
                    bird's-eye view, Overworld, Godview, overhead view or helicopter 
                    view, when used in video games refers to a camera angle that shows 
                    the player and the area around them from above. While not exclusive 
                    to video games that utilise parallel projection, it was at one time 
                    common in 2D role playing video games, wargames and construction and 
                    management simulation games such as SimCity, Pokémon, and Railroad 
                    Tycoon, as well as in action and action-adventure games such as the

                <p>A side-scrolling game or side-scroller is a video game in which the 
                    viewpoint is taken from the side, and the onscreen characters 
                    generally can only move, to the left or right. Games of this type 
                    make use of scrolling computer display technology, and sometimes 
                    parallax scrolling to suggest added depth. Examples of side-scrolling 
                    games include platform games such as Sonic the Hedgehog and 
                    Ori and the Blind Forest, beat 'em ups such as the popular 
                    Double Dragon and Battletoads, and shooters such as R-Type and 
                    (more recently) Jets'n'Guns. The Super Mario Bros. series has 
                    used all three types of side-scrolling at some time in its history.

                <p>2.5D ("two-and-a-half-dimensional"), 3/4 perspective and pseudo-3D 
                    are informal terms used to describe graphical projections and 
                    techniques that try to "fake" three-dimensionality, typically 
                    by using some form of parallel projection, wherein the point of 
                    view is from a fixed perspective, but also reveals multiple 
                    facets of an object. Examples of pseudo-3D techniques include 
                    isometric/axonometric projection, oblique projection, orthographic 
                    projection, billboarding, parallax scrolling, scaling, skyboxes, 
                    and skydomes. In addition, 3D graphical techniques such as 
                    bump mapping and parallax mapping are often used to extend the 
                    illusion of three-dimensionality without substantially increasing 
                    the resulting computational overhead introduced by increasing the 
                    polygon count. Examples of games that make use of pseudo-3D 
                    techniques include Zaxxon, The Sims and Diablo 
                    (isometric/axonometric projection); Ultima VII and Paperboy 
                    (oblique projection); Sonic the Hedgehog and Street Fighter II 
                    (parallax scrolling); Fonz and Space Harrier (scaling); and Half-Life 2 
                    (skyboxes). In addition to axonometric projection, games such as 
                    The Sims and Final Fantasy Tactics also make use of a combination 
                    of pre-drawn 2D sprites and real-time polygonal graphics instead 
                    of relying entirely on 2D sprites as is the norm.  
                </p>
                <p>3D</p>
                <p>With the advent of 3D accelerated graphics, video games could 
                    expand beyond the typically sprite-based 2D graphics of older 
                    graphics technologies to describe a view frequently more true to 
                    reality and lifelike than their predecessors. Perspective projection 
                    has also been used in some earlier titles to present a 3D view 
                    from a fixed (and thus somewhat less hardware-intensive) 
                    perspective with a limited ability to move.

                <p>Voxel engines, contrary to using triangle meshes, this uses Voxels.</p>
                <p>Fixed 3D refers to a three-dimensional representation of the 
                    game world where foreground objects (i.e. game characters) are 
                    typically rendered in real time against a static background. 
                    The principal advantage of this technique is its ability to 
                    display a high level of detail on minimal hardware. The main 
                    disadvantage is that the player's frame of reference remains 
                    fixed at all times, preventing players from examining or moving 
                    about the environment from multiple viewpoints. 
                </p>
                <p>First person refers to a graphical perspective rendered from 
                    the viewpoint of the player character. In many cases, this may 
                    be the viewpoint from the cockpit of a vehicle. Many different 
                    genres have made use of first-person perspectives, including 
                    adventure games, flight simulators, and the highly popular 
                    first-person shooter genre. 
                </p>
                <p>Third person refers to a graphical perspective rendered from a 
                    view that is some distance away (usually behind and slightly above) 
                    from the player's character. This viewpoint allows players to see 
                    a more strongly characterized avatar, and is most common in action 
                    and action-adventure games.
                </p>
                <p>Stereoscopic video games use stereoscopic technologies to create 
                    depth perception for the player by any form of stereo display. 
                    Such games should not to be confused with video games that use 
                    3D computer graphics, which although they feature graphics on 
                    screen, do not give the illusion of depth beyond the screen. 
                </p>
                <p>The graphics for virtual reality gaming consist of a special 
                    kind of stereo 3D graphics to fit the up-close display. The 
                    requirements for latency are also higher to reduce the potential 
                    for virtual reality sickness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many games can run multi-monitor setups to achieve very high display resolutions. 
                    Running games in this way can create a greater sense of immersion, e.g. 
                    when playing a video racing game or flight simulator or give a tactical 
                    advantage due to the higher resolution. 
                </p>
                <p>Augmented or mixed reality game graphics use images that partial 
                    overlay the image of reality seen through partial transparent glasses 
                    or captured with a camera and seen with a head-mounted display or 
                    other displays such as smartphone or tablet displays.

                <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Audio Style</h5>
                <p>Video game music is the soundtrack that accompanies video games. 
                    Early video game music was once limited to simple melodies of 
                    early sound synthesizer technology. These limitations inspired 
                    the style of music known as chiptunes, which combines simple melodic 
                    styles with more complex patterns or traditional music styles, 
                    and became the most popular sound of the first video games.</p>
                <p>With advances in technology, video game music has grown to include 
                    the same breadth and complexity associated with television and 
                    film scores, allowing for much more creative freedom. 
                    While simple synthesizer pieces are still common, game music 
                    now includes full orchestral pieces and popular music. 
                    Music in video games can be heard over a game's title screen, 
                    menus, as well as during gameplay. Game soundtracks can also 
                    change depending on a player's actions or situation, such as 
                    indicating missed actions in rhythm games, informing the player 
                    they are in a dangerous situation or rewarding them for certain achievements.</p>
                <p>Video game music can be one of two options: original or licensed. 
                    In order to create or collect this music, teams of composers, 
                    music directors, and music supervisors must work with the game 
                    developers and game publishers. 
                    The popularity of video game music has expanded education and 
                    job opportunities, generated awards, and allowed video game soundtracks 
                    to be commercially sold and performed in concerts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Few creative mediums let you explore stories like video games. 
                    Players don’t just watch a story—they participate in it, sometimes 
                    steering narratives to wildly divergent endings. But in order for 
                    an interactive experience to truly transport players, it needs 
                    to have a well-built world for them to live in. Here are some 
                    locales that stand out from the rest. The most memorable video 
                    game worlds come to the player steeped in story, teeming with 
                    possible paths to take and lives to intersect with. Characters 
                    whose existences you want to know more about, conflicts you’re 
                    compelled to join, spaces filled with mood and urgency… a good 
                    gameworld is a place you don’t want to leave.</p>

                <h4 class="sub-header">Monetization</h4>
                <p class="ex">How will the game make money? Premium purchase? F2P? 
                    How do you justify this within the design?
                </p>
                <p>Video game monetization is the type of process that a video game 
                    publisher can use to generate revenue from a video game product. 
                    The methods of monetization may vary between games, especially 
                    when they come from different genres or platforms, but they all 
                    serve the same purpose to return money to the game developers, 
                    copyright owners, and other stakeholders. As the monetization 
                    methods continue to diversify, they also affect the game design 
                    in a way that sometimes leads to criticism. 
                </p>
                <p>Although there are several business models to monetize video games, 
                    they can be categorized into six major models. 
                    A video game may use more than one of these models at once.</p>
                <p>Retail purchase is the traditional method by which games are sold 
                    from brick and mortar stores or online retailers. 
                    Customers pay for a physical copy of the game and any other 
                    game related peripheral devices required for play in-store. 
                    Retail purchasing has previously made up the bulk of game-related 
                    transactions, but it has been on the decline in recent years due 
                    to the rise of digital distribution and mobile gaming. 
                    However, the importance of brick and mortar game stores as a 
                    place for gamers to gather and show their passion still remains. 
                    Furthermore, some retail purchases may come with collectible boxes
                    and possible in-game items to attract customers over digital download.
                </p>
                <p>Digital distribution or digital download is similar in practice to 
                    retail purchasing, but is different in venue. Instead of acquiring 
                    a game through a physical store, customers buy their games online and 
                    download the game's data directly to their devices. Many games sold 
                    through digital download are distributed by means of a third-party service 
                    that functions in the same way as a physical store, selling a variety 
                    of games from many different developers in one location. 
                    Valve's Steam is an example of digital distribution platforms for PC gaming. 
                </p>
                <p>Subscription model is a business model where a game requires continuous, 
                    ongoing payments from customers in order to play the game. Games that utilize 
                    subscription often sell access in blocks of one-month increments or in multiples 
                    thereof. Once a subscription runs out or is canceled by a customer, their 
                    access to the game ceases or is reduced until they re-subscribe. 
                    This method is most often associated with games that require an online 
                    connection or services that require capital to operate on the part 
                    of the publisher or developer. An example of games that use subscription 
                    model is World of Warcraft.<br>
                    Subscription service is, on the other hand, not a direct subscription 
                    to a game but a subscription to gaming-related services. 
                    These services may include, but not limited to, monthly games 
                    such as Humble Bundle, temporary access to game library such as 
                    Origin Access, and access to multiplayer online session such as PlayStation Plus.
                </p>
                <p>Microtransaction is a business model where aspects of a game's 
                    contents can be purchased to enhance the game experience for the player. 
                    These aspects may range among new playable contents, in-game currencies, 
                    cosmetic options, and otherwise unavailable or restricted gameplay advantages. 
                    Traditionally, these purchases tend to be relatively inexpensive but 
                    numerous in variety. Microtransactions are often common in social and 
                    mobile games where potential customers may be hesitant to purchase a 
                    full game, but more at ease with smaller, yet more numerous payments. 
                </p>
                <p>Downloadable content (DLC) is a kind of microtransaction that 
                    expands the base game by providing additional contents. 
                    Depending on the game and publisher, a downloadable content 
                    may be a large expansion that greatly impacts the game, or a 
                    series of smaller expansions. 
                    These expansions can be either skins, maps, story, or even a 
                    new game mode based on the main game.</p>
                <p>Loot box is a variation of microtransaction of which the rewards are random. 
                    The player has no control over the rewards they receive for 
                    paying in-game or real world currencies although the game often 
                    shows a list of possible loots that the player may get from the 
                    loot box. The content of the loot box may range from purely 
                    cosmetic items with no effect on gameplay, such as skins in Overwatch, 
                    to powerful items with a gameplay advantage that otherwise the player 
                    has to grind to achieve. 
                    Some games may require the players to rely on loot box system 
                    to obtain characters and items more heavily than other games. 
                    They are sometimes referred to as a Gacha game.
                </p>
                <p>Player trading is a business model where in-game items and digital 
                    currencies can be traded between players on the game marketplace 
                    that allows the publisher to get a cut on transactions that players made. 
                    Most of the times, the publisher can get a percentage from every transactions, 
                    like Steam community market, or from a difference between buying 
                    and selling price of the in-game currency, like World of Warcraft.
                </p>
                <p>Advertising is a form of indirect monetization. Apart from 
                    aforementioned methods of monetization, indirect monetization 
                    generate revenue from other sources that does not directly come 
                    from the player. Most frequently, this is the placement of 
                    advertisements within a game; these may take the form of banner 
                    advertisements, commercial breaks in play, or product placement 
                    in the game. Games that rely on advertisement for returns 
                    usually are free-to-play or are cheaper than other games as 
                    their production cost has already been subsidized.</p>

                <p>Video game monetization has been criticized by journalists who 
                    see it as video game publishers being excessively greedy, in 
                    particular with the implementation of microtransactions. 
                    Games such as 2017's Star Wars Battlefront II have been 
                    criticized for gameplay elements that require extensive 
                    grinding which can otherwise be bypassed through loot boxes. 
                    The increasing adoption of loot boxes in gaming has led to 
                    some viewing the machinic as a form of online gambling, 
                    with many countries revising their laws in response.

                they look and how they’re played. With every passing year, the 
                variety of video game platforms expands. These platforms give 
                gamers different experiences: some virtually catapult you into a 
                fictional world, while others are simpler and better for gaming 
                on the go. To gain a better understanding of the many gaming 
                experiences now available, here’s a guide to some of the 
                different types of video game platforms.
            </p>
            <p>PC gaming is one of the best and oldest ways to experience video games. 
                Playing on a PC has many advantages, including higher-quality visuals 
                and more versatility. More often than not, game visuals are more superior 
                on a PC than on a gaming console—PC gaming allows for more customization 
                via various accessories and options that can enhance your experience. 
            </p>
            <p>Video game consoles from Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have been leading 
                the way in gaming platforms for years now. In fact, a 2018 study from 
                the Pew Research Center states that “84% of teens say they have… access 
                to a game console at home.” Gaming consoles are a bit easier to use compared 
                to PCs because console games are commonly played with controllers. 
                While many companies are already developing next-gen consoles, Sony 
                and Nintendo have also brought back classic consoles in miniature form, 
                such as the NES Classic.  
            </p>
            <p>A recent trend in gaming is the increased development of games for 
                mobile phones and tablets. Most people today carry a smartphone 
                with gaming capabilities; the games available on mobile devices 
                range across all different types of genres. This is an area on 
                which the gaming industry has recently capitalized with popular 
                titles such as Clash of Clans, Fortnite, and Angry Birds. 
                In recent years, mobile gaming has also taken advantage of 
                augmented reality with interactive games such as Pokémon Go and the 
                newly-released Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from mobile gaming, the gaming industry also continues to 
                push virtual reality forward, making huge strides in the platform. 
                VR puts you in the middle of a virtual world, and it’s one of the 
                most immersive gaming experiences available at the moment. VR requires 
                you to put on a headset, which allows you to see the virtual world; 
                Oculus, Sony, HTC, Samsung, and more brands offer many different 
                types of VR headsets. You’ll also use controls that allow you to 
                “move around” in the virtual world. To use VR safely, make sure 
                you have enough physical space. VR is a gaming platform that may 
                have the most potential beyond gaming, and we’ll continue to see it 
                move forward for years to come.
            </p>
            <p>Arcade games may seem like a dying gaming platform, but this is 
                far from the case. The thirst for nostalgia has never been greater, 
                and nothing quenches that thirst like arcade gaming. With games 
                such as Pacman, Donkey Kong, Galaga, and more, this platform was 
                the most popular way to game in the 80s. Back then, people typically 
                had to visit local arcades, restaurants, or movie theaters to get 
                their gaming in. Arcade games typically feature a large machine built 
                for one game. These games are still in production today and are 
                present in entertainment centers such as Dave & Busters and Main Event. 
                You can also buy an arcade station for yourself and build a collection 
                of your own.
            </p>
            <p>An often-overlooked way to play video games is on a television. 
                If you own a smart TV, you can actually download games and play 
                without a console. While every smart TV is different, most of 
                them offer app stores where you can download these games in the 
                same way you would download a mobile game. To play these games, 
                you may need to connect a gaming controller, but you get to enjoy 
                some pretty cool games on a large TV display, which is more 
                affordable than getting a console.
            </p>
            <p>Another easy way to game is to simply use a web browser. Thousands of 
                free games are available on the Internet, from games based on TV shows 
                to classics such as RuneScape and FarmVille. There are also plenty of 
                fun, educational games that can actually help with school, such as 
                Lemonade Stand. The Internet might be the most accessible way for 
                people of all ages to play games today.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final gaming platform in our list is one that is still a new, 
                exciting concept. TV has been transitioning into streaming, and 
                now video games are trying to do the same. In most cases, you have 
                to download a game in order to get good quality—however, Google is 
                looking to make gaming more like Netflix with its cloud gaming service, 
                Stadia. Instead of housing games on one platform, Stadia allows you 
                to game across many platforms by streaming the games in 4K. 
                This would make video games the latest piece of technology to 
                move into the cloud. This will also make gaming easier than ever 
                before and allow you to play wherever you want with a monthly subscription.
            </p>
            <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Technology, Game Engines</h5>
            <p>A game engine, also known as a game architecture, game framework or 
                gameframe, is a software-development environment designed for 
                people to build video games. Developers use game engines to construct 
                games for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers. 
                The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a 
                rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine 
                or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, 
                animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, 
                threading, localization support, scene graph, and may include video support for cinematics. 
                Implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting, 
                in large part, the same game engine to produce different games 
                or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms. </p>
                
            <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Technology, Coding Languages</h5>
            <p>While arguably most coding languages can be used to create games, 
                including high-level languages like Python, some choices do have 
                more benefits than others.  Additionally, choosing what programming 
                language to learn how to code may ultimately lock you into certain 
                engines or frameworks as well, which further affects the development 
                process of your game.  To make a long story short, choosing the right 
                language can be a stressful endeavor.</p>
            

            <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Scope, Team Size</h5>
            <p>The number of developers on a team is directly proportional to how close 
                they are to shipping. The further away you are, the fewer people you need. 
                I’ll try to give you a quick rundown of the various stages of development, 
                and the number of people a AAA game would need at that point.</p>
            <p>It generally starts with just the high level concept, the one-sentence 
                description of what the game is, like “it’s GTA with unicorns”, 
                “four versus one asymmetric pvp in space”, or “open world questing plus dating 
                sim”. Sometimes the concept is a name, and the question is what the 
                game will actually play like - “KOTOR 3”, “WiiU Metroid”, or “King’s Quest” 
                might be examples of this. This sort of thing usually only has a handful of 
                people at most - one lead and maybe one or two others.</p>
            <p>Once the high level idea has been approved by the publishing bigwigs, 
                the concept work begins. This is typically when the discipline directors 
                start planning - the technical director figures out what sort of 
                engineering will need to be done, the art director thinks about the 
                overall aesthetic and visual style of the game, the creative director 
                thinks about what the major gameplay features will be and how they 
                will interact with each other, and so on. The team here will generally 
                be around five people, maybe up to ten at most.</p>
            <p>After the leadership on the team and the core features are established, they can begin 
                bringing on some senior developers to help suss out the features 
                they’ve established in the previous stage. Engineers look at the 
                plan and weigh in with their assessments. Concept artists and 
                senior designers will iterate on the basic plot, character 
                concepts, environment concepts, and such to try to establish a 
                set of art for more a visual sense of what things will be. 
                Designers will likely start building small prototypes and 
                writing vision documents for what it is they are aiming for.</p>
            <p>Once this process begins, the inevitable goal is to reach the First Playable, 
                or Vertical Slice. Artists art, engineers engineer, designers design, 
                and they work towards building out a single contained game experience 
                that showcases examples of all the major features in the game. 
                At this point, you’re going to have a team of at least 20 or so, 
                with more people scheduled to join the team as preproduction nears 
                the end. The leadership is starting to bring on more experienced 
                (but not necessarily senior) developers to create the content that 
                goes into the vertical slice.</p>
            <p>After the vertical slice has been approved, production begins and the team starts aggressively 
                bringing people on to create all of the systems and features and 
                assets that need to be built for the rest of the game. This is 
                typically where the team swells - we’re usually looking at a steady 
                growth of anywhere from 100 to 200 total bodies for your typical 
                $50 million budget AAA game, with no cap for your enormous budgeted games 
                (GTA, Destiny, Assassin’s Creed, SWTOR, etc.) - some of those teams 
                have reached up to 1,000 people. The number will vary a bit here, 
                since a lot of studios have begun outsourcing the tasks that 
                typically need a lot of people for only part of the production 
                process to other studios. Most of these are art tasks, like building 
                props, textures, or cleaning up motion captured animations.</p>
            <p>For the last six months to a year or so of the project, you’ll 
                have your full complement of developers typically numbering between 
                100 and 200, with possibly additional QA, liaisons with other 
                helper studios, marketing, and so on. Then, after the game ships, 
                many people get shuffled off to other projects, smaller development 
                like DLCs, or let go (depending on the financial state of the 
                publisher and studio).
            </p>
            <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Scope, Stages of Video Game Development</h5>
            <p>Here are the following stages of game development, and the best ways of 
                learning game development (step by step).</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><p id="list-p">Step 1: High Concept</p>
                        The first major step in how to develop a game is the high concept. 
                        This is a general idea. It’s a very brief description where 
                        you try to distill your ideas down to a few sentences.
                    </li>
                
                    <li><p id="list-p">Step 2: Pitch</p>
                        This is the big one. You pitch your idea in a summarized 
                        form to best communicate ideas and their goals. It’s also 
                        a time to promote why it would be a prudent idea to develop 
                        financially and commercially.
                    </li>
                
                    <li><p id="list-p">Step 3: Concept</p>
                            Further along, this is the lovechild between the high 
                            concept and pitch. This is where you outline and describe 
                            all of the aspects of the game. We’re talking story, 
                            demographics, risk analysis and a boatload of 
                            further information.
                    </li>
                        
                    <li><p id="list-p">Step 4: Game Design Document</p>
                            This document includes aspects tied to actual 
                            gameplay and may include prototypical aspects of 
                            your project.
                    </li>
                
                    <li><p id="list-p">Step 5: Prototype</p>
                            This is where you and your team can shine early on. 
                            Building the prototype will allow you to develop the 
                            methods in which you’ll fully execute your idea. It’s 
                            a good way to build a proof of concept, adapting your 
                            goals into a more tangible form.
                    </li>
                
                    <li><p id="list-p">Step 6: Production</p>
                            
                        <ul class="li">
                            <li>Design</li>
                            <li>Creation</li>
                            <li>Programming</li>
                        </ul>
                            
                        <p id="list-p">This is when the ball starts to roll. Things like sound and early 
                        graphical assets begin to be implemented. The game is 
                        lifted off of the ground and finally starts to take shape. 
                        This is where programming comes into the game development process.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Scope, Agile Game Development</h5>
            <p>Agile is an approach for developing products (in this case: games) using 
                short iterations. The main idea is not making the whole project 
                from start to finish, but making small features for the current 
                project in small periods of time. In this way the results of each 
                iteration are used to adjust the project plan:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Each iteration is like a short project in itself</li>
                    <li>uses “inspect and adapt” practices to adjust the goals and measure progress</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Let’s say that we have a great idea of a game and we want to implement it. 
                In traditional planning we should step through 4 phases: Discover, Design, Develop and Test.</p> 
            <p>Once a phase is completed, then we follow the original plan step by step by 
            starting from one point and plan the directed work since a final goal is achieved. 
            When the game is finished and we are ready to ship it to our users we risk to 
            face a big problem: we have the perfect game played by nobody. At this point, 
            we are forced to change the plans and try to do things that our users want. 
            That’s why our End could not match the initially defined Goal. 
            This means that when we start to make a game we deal with a big “Cone of Uncertainty”.</p> 
            
            <p>Agile planning comes with small goals set for small periods of time and 
            forces us to step through all those 4 steps each iteration (about 2-4 weeks long). 
            At the end of each iteration we take a breath and look backward and try 
            to conclude the results. Using these results and the users need 
            we can adjust our initial plan and create some new goals. 
            This process iterates until our deadline is achieved.</p>
            
            <p>Agile approaches help us respond to unpredictability through incremental, 
                iterative work cadences and empirical feedback from users. When we start 
                to deliver a project we deal with different types of noise level, depending 
                on what we need to do (i.e. game requirements) and how we do it (i.e. technology used). 
                Based on these two dimensions we can classify our project in 4 types of problems:

                <ul class="list">
                <li>Simple – we can solve the problem by applying a predefined plan.</li>
                <li>Complicated – we can split the problem in smaller simple problems.</li>
                <li>Complex – we can use an empirical approach in order to see if the results are going in the right way.</li>
                <li> Anarchy – totally chaos.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>A game is part of the complex class because the output is influenced by so many external 
                factors and we need to inspect ourselves as soon as possible, try to get feedback 
                for our game as early as we can and adapt our plans according to our results. And here comes 
                the SCRUM process to help us.
            </p>
            <p>SCRUM is an iterative and incremental Agile process that produces 
                demonstrable working software every 2-4 weeks. Being results- and 
                commitment-oriented it has a long history of success on a wide variety 
                of projects,  including game development.</p>
            <p>Based on a product backlog that contains many features, the SCRUM process helps us to establish some goals 
                for small periods of time that are called sprints. Usually sprints are 2-4 weeks long. Once a sprint goal 
                is defined, then a set of tasks can be taken for development in order to achieve that goal. At the end 
                of the sprint, the team is able to ship an incrementally improved game. The result is fully functional 
                and testable by users so that each developed feature can receive that feedback that helps the game 
                development team to find the FUN needed in order to have a successful game on the market.</p>
            <p>SCRUM facilitates feature iteration, allowing teams to deliver polished, tuned and integrated 
                features which can be used to test the creative quality of the game throughout its development, 
                allowing the team to incorporate audience feedback as early as possible in 
                the development process.</p>
            <p>The SCRUM project community involves 3 roles with different responsibilities:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <p id=list-p>Product Owner</p>
                <li>Is responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI).</li>
                <li>Prioritizes features according to market value. </li>
                <li>Can change features and priority every sprint.</li>
                <li>Accepts or rejects work results.</li>
                <li>Defines the features of the product, decides on release date and content.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="list">

                <li>Demos work results to the Product Owner.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Meetings, or ceremonies are an important part of agile game development:</p>

            <h5 class="sub-sub-header">Scope, Game Production Cycle</h5>
            <p>Here are the different phases of the game production cycle.</p>
            <p>Preproduction is when you’re still coming up with ideas. 
                Who the characters are, what the main gameplay systems are going to be, 
                the general hashing out of the scope of the project, and 
                then writing a lot of documents and coming up with requirements lists. 
                This is where you do all the planning and prototyping to try to plan 
                it out and make the game fun. This phase will end with what’s 
                generally known as a “vertical slice” or a “first playable”. </p>
            <p>The first playable will be near-production quality demo of the game, 
                and have a sample of each major game system you plan on fully developing. 
                For a game like Halo, for example, this will mean you have shields 
                and health, different sorts of weapons, enemies that look and 
                behave differently, at least one vehicle, and some sort of playable 
                level with objectives and the like. The systems and gameplay 
                is by no means exhaustive, but you have an example of each sort of 
                gameplay you want to put in for the core gameplay loop in the final game. 
                This gets shown to the higher ups like the publisher executives, 
                who will get a chance to try it out and see how it plays. 
                If they approve it, the team moves on to Production.</p>
            <p>Production is where the majority of the content gets made. This 
                is where you flesh out those prototype systems, make the rest of 
                the areas in the game, create the talent trees and other classes 
                that you planned but haven’t actually created, and things like that. 
                Production time typically means you try to get everything important 
                into the game, and then start cutting things that won’t be done in 
                time to make sure you can finish the more important things. Some of 
                this content gets removed altogether because it just isn’t feasible 
                or fun enough. Some of it gets set aside for later - in the old days, 
                it was the potential fodder for expansion packs or rolled into the 
                sequel development. These days, it often gets repurposed to be DLC 
                content instead. This is the period where the team tends to grow, 
                hiring more programmers, designers, and artists to create the 
                content the team needs. Production ends when the schedule says it does. 
                Once the scheduled time is done, the game is called Feature Complete, 
                and development transitions into the Alpha phase.</p>
                <p>Alpha (green) is when the development team focuses on stability 
                    and bug fixing, and stop adding new systems, features, and content. 
                    A lot of the systems and features that were built during the 
                    Production phase are not fully functional. The systems generally 
                    work ~90% of the time, but the remaining 10% are comprised of 
                    edge cases that just weren’t expected early on. This is what 
                    the team focuses on fixing during the Alpha phase. During this 
                    phase, you often have what’s called a Burndown chart - every day, 
                    QA will find and enter a certain number of bugs. The developers 
                    usually have to fix more bugs each day than QA can find in order 
                    to approach zero bugs project-wide. There generally isn’t new 
                    feature or content work being done during Alpha, that’s why it 
                    is feature complete. It’s only fixing bugs, fixing crashes, 
                    making things smoother and flow better, and improving performance. 
                    More content cutting occurs at this phase as well - things that 
                    can’t be done in time, or will require more work than the team 
                    has time for. Sometimes it’s because the particular developers 
                    who own the feature are just swamped, and it would take too long 
                    to train someone else to help share the burden. As the game 
                    hardens and becomes more stable, the leadership will begin 
                    locking down certain sections of the game to keep them stable 
                    so that new bugs are not introduced. Levels, systems, sounds, 
                    art assets, etc. around this time start getting locked down. 
                    This lockdown leads to the Beta phase.
                </p>
                <p>The Beta phase is where the game is considered “content complete” - 
                    no new content allowed at all. The only thing that is done 
                    is fixing of existing bugs, and the lower priority bugs tend 
                    to get put on the wishlist or marked as ‘shippable’. At this 
                    point stability is the most valuable thing. The leadership on 
                    the project has to carefully evaluate what goes in, and how 
                    risky the fixes are. This is often where the nastier hacks in 
                    the game get made, because the hacks are smaller and localized 
                    to fix a very specific problem rather than the “correct” fix 
                    at the root of the issue, simply because the hack affects 
                    significantly less in the grand scheme of things. Beta ends 
                    when the team has a final submission candidate, and the team 
                    enters the Final phase.
                </p>
                <p>The final phase is about where most 
                    of the team used to idle at work, waiting for the results of 
                    the certification process. Nowadays, members of the team get 
                    transitioned to work on extra content, patch fixes, or other 
                    projects in development at this point, while the smaller core 
                    team works on the critical cert-threatening issues.</p>
